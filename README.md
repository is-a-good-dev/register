Your pull request **will not** be merged if:
- You already own a subdomain on our service.
- The records provided includes invalid/unpermitted record types. If this happens we will notify you and request changes.
- It violates users privacy.
- It uses Vercel or Netlify, as there are issues with subdomain verification. We hope to add support back soon.
